## ðŸ˜´ Lazy execution

In django, sql queries are not evaluated until they are iterated over.

> The act of creating a QuerySet doesnâ€™t involve any database activity. You can stack filters together all day long, and Django wonâ€™t actually run the query until the QuerySet is evaluated.

```python
q = Entry.objects.filter(headline__startswith="What")
q = q.filter(pub_date__lte=datetime.date.today())
q = q.exclude(body_text__icontains="food")
print(q) # SQL hits
```

## ðŸ¤” Isnt being lazy good for performance?

Being lazy might be thought of as a performance boost as you are only executing query when required. But this may lead
to multiple queries being made to the database unknowingly.

```
~~~graph-easy --as=boxart
[ ModelA ] - one-to-one -> [ ModelB ]
~~~
```

```python
qs = ModelA.objects.all()

# a serializer step that adds ModelB
serializer = ModelASerializer(qs, many=True)
return qs
```

> Here for each Object of ModelA you are hiting the db for ModelB.

## ðŸ¤¦ Whats the problem?

```
~~~graph-easy --as=boxart
[ Network calls ] - slower -> [ Python ] - slower -> [ SQL land]
~~~
```

---

## âœ… Solution

**Try to make a bigger SQL query.**

```python
qs = ModelA.objects.all().select_related('modelB') # includes SQL code for ModelB
serializer = ModelASerializer(qs, many=True) # doesn't make new SQL request for getting ModelB
return qs

```
